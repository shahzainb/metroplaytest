## Test Notes

Steps Taken:

1. Create a new Nodejs and Express App (10 minutes)
2. Create an AWS ELB instance to run the server (10 minutes)
3. Deploy test app (5 minutes)
4. Create the index.html view structure based on wireframe (10 minutes)
5. Add scripts and stylesheets (angular, html5shiv, purecss, styles, etc) (3 minutes)
5. Style the structure going mobile-first (30 minutes)
6. Style the tablet structure (10 minutes)
7. Fix desktop structure (5 minutes)
8. Add angular app js file, controller and services js files (10 minutes)

10. Inject data into the view (3 minutes)
10. Fix IE8 styles (20 minutes)
11. Add images to the json file (3 minutes)

Total Time: 2 hours and 4 minutes. This doesn't include some small fixes that I did after the fact such as writing this notes and small typo fixes. These can be followed on the commit history.

## Reasoning

The reason I used NodeJs and AngularJs is to create a proper application structure that is scalable and maintainable.

Instead of just creating a regular html file with styles, I opted for doing things properly engineered.

I used LESS as well for writing coherent and structured CSS.

I used Pure CSS for responsive grids and basic layout styling.

I used HTML5Shiv and Placeholder polyfill for <IE8 fixes.

AngularJS includes form validation as a basic normality.
