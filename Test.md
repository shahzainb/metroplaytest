**One page UI test**

Using the assets attached, build a responsive webpage. Make sure you add your comments on the source code. It is ok to use libraries though I am mostly interested on how you code your HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- Make sure you use the assets, content and wireframes provided.
- Make sure your page **gracefully degrades** to IE8 and below.
- Use the images wisely and apply responsive images techniques, specially around different mobile screens.
- Make sure you include a basic JavaScript validation.
- Make sure all of your code is validated and up to standards and best practices.

*We believe this test can be completed in 2-4 hours. If you spend less/more time than that, please indicate where you spent your time.
